<p><span style="font-size: x-large;">Constructing the abject in the works of Hieronymus Bosch</span></p>
<p>The composition of the images in my work is similar to Hieronymus Bosch’s construction of his demoniac figures. Monstrous hybrids of insects, reptiles,<br />
chunks of human anatomy and bits of machinery all merge to accentuate the grotesque while at the same time drawing the viewer in with their seductive colour and lustrous palette. I draw on Carl Linfert' s interpretation of this enigmatic painter who says that by presenting all elements as contaminated by a devilish brood. In "Garden of Earthly Delights", c.1504 Bosch escapes from the traditional Christian belief of afterlife judgment. He then infers that the price of sin is on-earth suffering.</p>
<p>Christian sin, according to Kristeva is a form of abjection, and is the “threatening otherness” . There, the sinful person experiences on-earth suffering when rejection by fellow human beings isolates the subject from the spiritual order. The subsequent abjection experienced by the sinful is well illustrated in Bosch’s explorations of demonic figures. In my work, I merge animals and objects with human figures even though I choose at times not to render this merger visually obvious.</p>
