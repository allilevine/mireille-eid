<h1>Introduction</h1></p>
<p>
  I, like most human beings, am constantly crossing boundaries. Each crossing throws me in deep torments and makes me come face to face with the abject. It is only when I embrace the abject that I am then able to surface and understand both the meaning and necessity of each passage.</p>
<p><p>  In this dissertation I will explore the abject as it relates to art and motherhood and therefore I will firstly address the general context for the term and its appearance in contemporary theoretical writing. I willthen explain how my work relates to abject theories, in particular a form I call the maternal abject. </p>
<p>Historically, Bataille calls abjection the inability to come to terms with the imperative of excluding the repulsive. He places the abject at the heart of our collective existence and tests the hypocrisy of a social order through its treatment of the abject. Kristeva defines the abject as a state of crisis, of self-disgust and disgust towards others. It is not so much the physically repulsive but that which disturbs identity, social or theological systems. Kristevaâ€™s definition of the abject encompasses a wide range of ideas and situations which interest me and which are relevant to my research. For this reason, I will focus my research on her writing and the interpretive writings of Elizabeth Grosz.</p>
<p>Then, following a discussion of the above, I will explore the maternal abject. This form of the abject is the one I am most interested in, and the one which manifests itself in my artwork and indeed in the works of the artists who inspire my work. My interest in the maternal abject is a search into all the processes a woman undergoes when she becomes a mother and the subsequent mother/child separation. The latter occurs when the child forms its own identity as separate from the mother and realises that it has a body and an identity of its own. My search for what binds me and separates me from my own children is the driving force behind this particular art project. </p>
<p>From the above, I take on a political stand to bring to light the misconceptions about the place of the mother in the history of art and the effect of the maternal abject on some artists. Physical, semiotic and social phenomena take place when the child separates from the mother and forms its own identity. I will highlight how this separation manifests itself in relation to art and motherhood. These issues, which have historically not been given much credence, fuel my art and my need to give a visual representation of what it is to be a mother. From this viewpoint, I will discuss representations of the mother in the work of contemporary artists. </p>
<p>I will investigate the barriers and misconceptions, which a woman faces when she enters motherhood. I will examine the way motherhood in society is relegated to the domestic and how this renders her invisible. I am hoping that through my art, I can reach a better understanding of this phenomenon and bring it to the public attention.</p>
<p>Aesthetically, I am most interested in exploring my fascination with the abject and its visual representation. Therefore, I will examine how other artists relate to the abject and whether my obsession with the abject is a personal trajectory or a well-rooted enquiry into the artistic process. As such, I will investigate how some artists deal with the abject such as with the works of Francis Bacon, Joel-Peter Witkin, Paul Quinn, Mona Hatoum, Hieronymus Bosch, Fiona Hall and Gregory Crewdson, and those who deal with the maternal abject specifically; artists such as Mary Kelly, Louise Bourgeois, Frida Kahlo, and Cindy Sherman.</p>
