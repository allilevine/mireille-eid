<p><h1>Abjection in the Artistic Process</h1></p>
<p>  I have looked at theories of abjection through Kristeva and the interpretive writings of Grosz; the role of the maternal in abjection theory and the relationship between acquisition of language, a child's separation from the mother and the mapping of the body, the latter being a signifier in social orders, taboos and sin. Through this search to understand my fascination with the abject and its manifestation in my own art practice, I begin to examine the relationship between the artistic process and the maternal abject. </p>
<p>First, I examine Kristeva's analysis of the artistic process. She says, that the aesthetic process consists in finding a certain harmony between the </p>
<blockquote>&#147;semiotic functions and the energy discharges that connect and orient the body to the mother.&#148; <sup>1</sup></blockquote>
<p>
 She explains that the aesthetic process is a form of pursuit to resolve or harmonise the conflict between the semiotic and the forces which gyrates the person towards the mother's body. </p>
<blockquote>
  &quot;We must emphasise that &#147;drives&#147; are always already ambiguous, simultaneously assimilating and destructive; this dualism... makes the semiotized body a place of permanent scission.<sup>2</sup></blockquote>
<p>In an interview on the Tate exhibition "Rites of Passage, Art for the End of the Century", she explains how the art works have a cathartic value and how the artists who produce them are in a temporary state of harmony while experiencing a malaise. She further explains however that the artistic process "does not seal the [malaise] off or ignore it."<sup>3</sup></p>
<p>
  The abject by definition is that which disturbs identity, systems or orders. It is by its very nature the permanent scission or crisis, which resides in the life of the individual. This scission has its roots at the time the infant separates from its mother and performs its first act of non-corporal abjection. It is also the time the body of the infant is mapped through the teaching of the language and the initiation of what is taboo and what is the norm. Through this mapping, the individual is introduced to the particular social structure it will grow in. For example, in a specific Islamic culture, a baby girl who is not yet verbal learns through signs and while acquiring language, that hair on a girl's head must be covered, whereas hair on the body is considered unclean and must be removed. Therefore, a girl's hair becomes a signifier for a range of prohibitions, which form the basis of that particular social order. At a particular time in history and in a certain social hierarchy, Chinese girl's feet had to remain small and were painfully bound restricting the girl/woman's movement. A girl or woman's feet therefore become a signifier for a complete set of social rules and expectations. In Jewish and Islamic cultures a baby boy's circumcision is performed as a ritual and become the basis of what is clean and unclean within a social and spiritual order.</p>
<p>

  These three examples illustrate how the mapping of an infant's body is the building block of social structures and the possible site of scission or malaise in an artist. Shirin Neshat is an artist who illustrates well how the body is mapped through the veil and how this mapping becomes a malaise or a scission in the life of Neshat. In her work Rapture and many of her previous works, she focuses on the meaning of the hidden female body in an Islamic culture, in particular the veil. She also illustrates how it acts as a object of repression. I quote James Rondeau in an explanation of her work:</p>
<blockquote>
  "Neshat maintains a critical distance that has allowed her to locate both the poetics and the power of the veil. At the same time that she celebrates the strength and beauty of Islamic women, however, she remains keenly aware of the horrors of repression."<sup>4</sup></blockquote>
<p>

  Neshat shows us how when she expresses her abject experience in a particular social or spiritual order, she inadvertently refers to the maternal abject which, as mentioned above, constitutes the mapping of the body (in this instance the covering or removal of a woman's hair), separation from the mother, and acquisition of language.</p>
<p>

  Kristeva postulates that there exists in the life of the artist an oscillating continuum between the production of art and the coming to terms with the presence of a scission or separation. </p>
<p>

  It then follows, from a psychoanalytical point of view, that in order for the artist to exist, s/he has to experience a state of conflict echoing the original abject experience that begins at the time the child tries to separate from its mother. The maternal abject with its scission and malaise therefore becomes the driving force behind my own art practice. Through becoming a mother I have become a witness to the formation of the maternal abject in my children. This observation has led me to examine my own work in that light, and that of other artists who illustrated the maternal abject in their own work.</p>
