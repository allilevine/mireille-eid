<h1>Psychoanalysis, the Maternal abject and the works of Louise Bourgeois</h1></p>
<p>
  Louise Bourgeois deals with the abject through body parts according to the Kleinian model. Rosalind Krauss explains Bourgeois’ works through the fantasies initiated by involuntary bodily drives on body parts, this way:</p>

  <blockquote>&#147;The part-object, speaks to the imperiousness of the drives, to the rapacity of their demands, to the way the body can, in the grip of fantasy, be riven.&quot;<sup>1</sup></blockquote>
<p>
This aggression on body parts is a system, which I use in my work, however rather than isolating the parts I fuse them in the one image in a dislocatory manner in order to render them grotesque and to highlight the monstrous. The bassinet on the other hand, like Bourgeois’s spider, is my way of projecting aggression onto a destructive external object. Bourgeois explains her need to harmonise her maternal abject through this analysis of her own state of mind:</p>
<blockquote>At that point, I had my subject. I was going to express what I felt towards her….First of all I cut her head, and slit her throat….And after weeks of work, I thought, if this is the way I saw my mother, then she did not like me….What you do to a person has nothing to do with what you expect the person to feel toward you…. Now at the end I became very depressed, terribly, terribly depressed.&#148;<sup>2</sup></blockquote>
<p>  Clearly, in this instance Bourgeois felt unable to come to terms with this abject experience, a graphic illustration of her need to kill her mother, which led her to experience anxiety about aggression and its destructive effect. This is abjection and is what keeps driving Bourgeois to search for harmony in the aesthetic process.</p>
