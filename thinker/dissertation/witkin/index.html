  Joel-Peter Witkin is another artist who works with the abject as a way to expose and accept it. Both attraction and repulsion are fundamentally embodied in his work. His manufactured scenes, as in Feast of Fools, 1990 resonate with a Renaissance tableau (this time Caravaggio’s). </p>
<p>
  These scenes are both attractive and grotesque forcing the viewer to not only admire the sensual beauty of the repulsive but to face the horrific. Body parts sewn up in vaginal shapes amongst putrid but sensual fruits such as grapes and pomegranate serve to take the viewer further along the road of the maternal abject. Witkin says:<br />
“I have devoted my soul to the philosophical and artistic investigation of what it means to be human”<sup>1</sup><br />
This investigation is not dissimilar to the way I make art. Mine is a search into my own psyche in order to understand better what it is to be human and more precisely, the nature of being female. </p>
