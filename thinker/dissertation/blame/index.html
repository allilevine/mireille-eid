  I have examined the relationship between the abject and art through an investigation into various artists’ projects. What I would like to emphasise here is that this investigation should not lead the reader into the well known response of “blaming” mothers for causing the maternal abject or conflict in artists. It is intended as an examination of the point at which the artist and the mother become separate entities, without either having any conscious awareness of the natural laws governing this mother/ child relationship. Susan Maushardt explains this unfortunate pitfall this way:</p>
<blockquote>“Where motherhood has been the subject of serious, sustained enquiry, it has been seen almost invariably as a cause, not an effect. This tendency is particularly marked in the field of psychology, wherein researchers have historically been more interested in apprehending mothers than comprehending them.”<sup>1</sup></blockquote>
<p>Comprehension is in fact the driving force behind my investigation, which is more a reading into my own psyche. This investigation aims at creating a field of questions and answers in order to open the reading of my visual work. As such I was driven to investigate whether some artists have been subjected to a psychological reading of their work and whether the maternal abject featured in their various projects. I will look at Frida Kahlo and Louise Bourgeois.</p>
