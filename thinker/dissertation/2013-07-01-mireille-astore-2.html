<p class="ariel">
  Through the process of art making I explore my own psyche. I am currently searching<br />
  for my own identity as a mother and that of my children, through the paths that<br />
  link us and the channels that separate us. It is a process of trying to understand<br />
  the nature of that most intense form of love that occurs between two human beings.<br />
  A love whose roots stem from an abject relationship whereby a mother tries to<br />
  keep herself bound to the child whilst at the same time working continuously<br />
  at teaching her child to become independent, to acquire language and finally,<br />
  to separate from her. John Lechte interprets the role of this love as necessary<br />
  for the child to exit the oral and anal phase and to enter the acquisition of<br />
language phase. </p>
<p class="ariel"><span class="ariel"><br />
  I believe that it is in the maternal that the abject is most prominent. If we<br />
  were to itemise the abject, the cycle begins at the onset of pregnancy with<br />
  the woman's &quot;nausea&quot; &#150; also known as morning sickness. There,<br />
  the abject resides within the visceral substance of the lining of the womb for<br />
  the duration of the pregnancy. <br />
  Grosz interprets Kristeva&#146;s abject this way: </span></p>
<p class="ariel"><span class="ariel"><br />
  &#147;Like the abject, maternity is the splitting, fusing, merging, fragmenting<br />
  of a series of bodily processes outside the will or control of the subject&#148;<br />
  <font size="-3">1</font></span></p>
<p class="ariel"><span class="ariel"><br />
  The abject surfaces again during the birthing drive with the painful convulsions<br />
  of the womb known as contractions, the rupture of the membranes and the gushing<br />
  of the amniotic fluid. Abjection then intensifies with the emergence of a squirming<br />
  visceral infant possibly via a tear in the woman&#146;s flesh, as in an episiotomy<br />
  or in a caesarean section. There, both mother and child face simultaneously<br />
  and yet not independently, the life and death drives. The umbilical cord, another<br />
  piece of flesh, is cut with a sharp instrument to initiate the transformation<br />
  of one being into two. Finally, the placenta, which has been the life- giving<br />
  force for the infant, is expelled from the woman&#146;s body, not unlike shit.<br />
</span></p>
<p class="ariel"><span class="ariel"><br />
  Very soon after the birthing process, abjection presents itself with the cause<br />
  and effect process: mother's breast milk/ infant's shit. For the mother, the<br />
  infant's shit, as separate from the screams, becomes the most intimate way the<br />
  child could communicate with her. Through this shit: its colour, consistency<br />
  and frequency, the mother faces the abject and returns herself to the pre-verbal<br />
  stage of signs in order to learn and interpret the child's needs. It is at the<br />
  end of the breast milk/infant's shit phase that another form of abjection takes<br />
  place: the child's separation from the mother, its acquisition of language and<br />
  the mapping of its body.<br />
  Rosalind Krauss explains:</span></p>
<p class="ariel"><span class="ariel"><br />
  &quot;&#133;the child's losing battle for autonomy is performed as a kind of<br />
  mimicry of the impassability of the body's own frontier, with freedom coming<br />
  only delusively as the convulsive, retching evacuation of one's own insides,<br />
  and thus abjection of oneself.&quot;<font size="-3"> 2</font></span></p>
<p class="ariel"><span class="ariel"><br />
  In other words, Krauss alludes to the fact that as a child attempts to separate<br />
  from its mother it approaches the act of abjection in order to free itself from<br />
  within. From the time of birth, up until the child begins to form its own identity,<br />
  it does not distinguish between its own body and that of its mother. Therefore<br />
  to the infant, the mother&#146;s body is an extension or a part of its own,<br />
  and it remains so until the child recognises firstly its own body parts, then<br />
  its unified body. As such, the child is driven to expel the mother in order<br />
  for it to exist. It is as if the child instinctively feels that as long as the<br />
  mother is within it, it will never be allowed to grow and form an identity.<br />
  Expulsion of the mother&#146;s body is the child&#146;s first act of non-corporeal<br />
  abjection such as sucking, screaming, shitting or vomiting. Therefore, by attempting<br />
  to understand our relationship to the maternal or indeed trace its origin, we<br />
  are in fact trying to understand our state of abjection. </span></p>
<p class="ariel"><span class="ariel"><br />
  Kristeva explains how separation from the mother coincides with the acquisition<br />
  of language through the negation of the image and the isolated object. In effect,<br />
  what Kristeva is saying is that, the relationship between a pre-verbal infant's<br />
  physical world which constitutes its mother's body, and the infant's attempts<br />
  at formulating language and entering the semiotic, has to reach a state of crisis<br />
  for the acquisition of language to occur. This is abjection and this is where<br />
  the process of negating the maternal presence or separating from her, becomes<br />
  a prerequisite to the child's acquisition of language. </span></p>
<p class="ariel"><span class="ariel"><br />
  Kristeva goes even further and relates the authority of the semiotic, the system<br />
  of written and spoken signs, to another very important aspect of a child&#146;s<br />
  socialisation : the mapping of the body.</span></p>
<p class="ariel"><span class="ariel"><br />
  &quot; Through frustrations and prohibitions, this authority shapes the body<br />
  into a territory having areas, orifices, points and lines, surfaces and hollows,<br />
  where the archaic power of mastery and neglect, of the differentiation of proper-clean<br />
  and improper-dirty, possible and impossible, is impressed and exerted.&quot;<br />
  <font size="-3">3</font> </span></p>
<p class="ariel"><span class="ariel"><br />
  Therefore, this is where the body and the mapping process become the point upon<br />
  which all social systems and orders are built. Again Kristeva points out how<br />
  the mother's body becomes the mediator of the symbolic law organising social<br />
  relations. </span></p>
<p class="ariel"><span class="ariel"><br />
  Grosz also explains how abjection serves the post-separation child to connect<br />
  different parts of its body. In other words, it is necessary to make the child<br />
  realize that its own toes are connected to its own leg for example, and that<br />
  the leg belongs to the self. Also that the child&#146;s hands, which are touching<br />
  its own stomach, are all parts of a unified subject called &#147;my body&#148;.<br />
  She further explains how understanding abjection involves examining the ways<br />
  in which the inside and the outside of the body relate, such as with food, or<br />
  air, and the means by which the child&#146;s body becomes a unified whole. </span></p>
<p class="ariel"><span class="ariel"><br />
  Melanie Klein&#146;s psychic analysis of the child&#146;s separation from the<br />
  mother is based upon a field of objects to be fused or split, possessed or destroyed<br />
  by means of fantasies produced by bodily drives. According to Klein, the first<br />
  object of aggression for example is not the mother or father, but a series of<br />
  part-objects &#150; breasts, milk, penis, children etc. to which the infant<br />
  fantasizes the connection of other part-objects &#150; mouth, teeth, urine,<br />
  shit <font size="-3">4</font>. Therefore through these fantasies, the body is<br />
  mapped and a social order is built upon. <br />
