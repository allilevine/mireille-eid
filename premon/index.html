<p><font face=" Arial, Helvetica, san-serif">In Premonitions I am exploring the theme of childhood in contemporary society.</font></p>
<p><font face=" Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"><br /> Premonitions, is an exhibition comprising digital photography and sculpture.  The images are created and displayed using a dialogical narrative, which sets  out to question what it means to be a child in the age of globalisation, wars  on terrorism and the disintegration of the real. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"><br /> Anne Higonnet in her book. Pictures of Innocence: The History and Crisis of  Ideal Childhood says: &#147;Images of children guard the cherished ideal of  childhood innocence, yet they contain within them the potential to undo that  ideal.&#148; I believe the archaic protective role a parent plays is essentially  underpinned not by love but by fear. Therefore, the images in Premonitions echo  Higonnet&#146;s concern in that they remind us of the fragility and brevity  of life and yet are contaminated with the seductive power of an aesthetic that  is both exquisite and uncompromising. </font></p>
<p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"><br /> In Premonitions I am focusing on childhood outside the boundaries of love, play  and laughter. In fact injury, illness, and predators seem to me like shrines  to mortality in a ritual of evasion, repression, and abjection. The images I  create paradoxically blur and identify these themes.</font></p>
<p><font face=" Arial, Helvetica, san-serif"><br /> I attempt to position the art at the heart of the digital era by transforming  the photographic image into a three dimensional mosaic of colour, texture and  theme. I use lush and rich surfaces reminiscent of Renaissance paintings in  order to give the images a historical context and to position the works in an  evolutionary continuum. As such, the primordial parental fear is rendered visible  through the inherent intensity of the images.</font></p>
