<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On my window sill</p>
<p>there is a vase</p>
<p>and a poem.</p>
<p>In the vase</p>
<p>there are five feathers.</p>
<p>They tickle me with forgotten voyages.</p>
<p>The tuft at the bottom scatter</p>
<p>like tentacles peering over my desk</p>
<p>they listen to words I scribble in a hurry.</p>
<p>The poem</p>
<p>printed as a postcard</p>
<p>about two hens sitting in the sun throwing<br />
  seeds of hope to winds of a future</p>
<p>has bent and split corners.</p>
<p>They tell of hundreds of people fumbling it<br />
  through a rack of postcards</p>
<p>of a friend placing it in her insecurities<br />
  filled handbag</p>
<p>of her scratching the back with sinuous thoughts</p>
<p>of a long wait in a dark letter box</p>
<p>of a journey at ten thousand metres</p>
<p>and of me</p>
<p>reading it a thousand times over</p>
<p>memorising ten years worth of unspoken words.</p>
