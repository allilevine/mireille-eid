<p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>  Gliding <br />
  in shatterproof gear<br />
  with a mask<br />
  that says &#8220;Break&#8221;<br />
  She mingles <br />
  composed<br />
  sealed and delivered<br />
  Summer is calling<br />
  Reason keeps her straight<br />
  But<br />
  in doorways<br />
  you keep her waiting<br />
  for what&#8217;s left of her gait<br />
  Here<br />
  Acid rains<br />
  do not reach the low grounds<br />
  flesh woven into silk<br />
  In respite<br />
  she enters hollowed earth <br />
  for<br />
  cuts do matter there<br />
  entr&eacute;e&#8217;s for subterranean Gods <br />
  noblemen <br />
  and warriors.</p>
