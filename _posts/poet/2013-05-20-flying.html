<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When your love for a man</p>
<p>slices your tongue to shreds</p>
<p>and the silence</p>
<p>bruises your lips</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When your love for a man</p>
<p>drills a hole in your head</p>
<p>and blood is spraying your walls</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When your love for a man</p>
<p>turns your shroud inside out</p>
<p>and calls on you to die</p>
<p>slowly once more.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Then it's time for you</p>
<p>to search for your hands</p>
<p>Find them and swallow them.</p>
<p>Beneath scarred skin</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>They will reach your heart.</p>
<p>Pull at it, throw it</p>
<p>but don't sit and wait</p>
<p>Stagnant blood no longer floods your veins</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go and dive</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Go and fly</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The wind is your wing</p>
<p>the sun your aim.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
