<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the morning</p>
<p>as I walk past the old people's home</p>
<p>I look at the row of windows</p>
<p>and see my reflection</p>
<p>again and again.</p>
<p>Every two steps</p>
<p>it appears</p>
<p>then disappears.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>One day</p>
<p>one of the windows was open</p>
<p>An old foot on white sheets appeared</p>
<p>A calm foot</p>
<p>It was shiny and pale.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the morning</p>
<p>as I walk the old people's home</p>
<p>an old foot chases my steps</p>
<p>watching me</p>
<p>wear out my shoes.</p>
