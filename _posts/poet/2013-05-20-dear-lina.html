<p>Dear Lina, </p>
<p>  I came across your <em><a href="http://www.linasaneh-body-p-arts.com/parts_studio.html" target="_blank">Appendice</a></em><br />
  last night <br />
  when I was looking <br />
  for a body <br />
  I could read at bedtime.<br />
  But to have you dying<br />
  in that way<br />
  on the other side of the universe <br />
  fragments began to tear away.</p>
<p>  I had imagined you <br />
  in that after-dying glow<br />
  not believing what you'd seen <br />
  nor what you'd heard <br />
  rising from ashes<br />
  to <em>eat men like air</em>.</p>
<p>
  And laws?<br />
  They came and they went <br />
  on the breath of ghosts<br />
  visiting the city that had tempted you <br />
  impotently <br />
  with wishes designed for mortals.</p>
<p>  A single encounter<br />
  that's all it took <br />
  to become afflicted <br />
  by the <em>nabrat</em> in your voice.<br />
  I have been warned <br />
  about this vigilance <br />
  of capturing vibes I do not want<br />
  but nonetheless need<br />
  … desperately.</p>
<p>
  It might be said <br />
  that eternal patience can burn <br />
  on pyres not built for you<br />
  But why must gifts come undone<br />
  when you ask me to<br />
  sign away<br />
  a part of you</p>
<p>me?</p>
<p>
  Love,<br />
  Mireille</p>
<p> </p>
