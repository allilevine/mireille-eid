<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I am strolling down the foyer of the library</p>
<p>heading towards my 5 o'clock shift</p>
<p>when I suddenly stop and listen to the silence around me.</p>
<p>Silence growing between the thin piles of the eroded carpet</p>
<p>out of beeping OPAC terminals and into questioning minds.</p>
<p>Silence sitting on a high chair pondering</p>
<p>the monolith of absolute learning</p>
<p>seeping the oxygen of laughter, sleep and rage.</p>
<p>Silence, gliding the tight rope of one's worth and one's dreams.</p>
<p>Silence, the waiting in the fog for an autumn leaf to fall.</p>
<p>Silence, the hissing of conscience, guilt and pride.</p>
<p>Silence, the void one grabs when one has no name.</p>
<p>Silence, the oasis in a desert of choices and crimes.</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
