<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Is this the hand I carry</p>
<p>Floating and brushing my memory?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Something is tapping at my temples</p>
<p>Something to last perhaps</p>
<p>Something to mourn even.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Maybe</p>
<p>From within desert dunes,</p>
<p>Your hand</p>
<p>Will sprout blades </p>
<p>Of grass</p>
<p>And will hold the brilliant silk scarves</p>
<p>That cover my gaze.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And yet</p>
<p>And yet</p>
<p>Something is tapping at my temples</p>
<p>Something to last perhaps</p>
<p>Something to mourn even.</p>
