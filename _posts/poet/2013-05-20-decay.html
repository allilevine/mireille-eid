<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I walk the sunrise</p>
<p>my body takes a form.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Wobbling crows on cliffs</p>
<p>plunge for the bulging eyes</p>
<p>the sea has expunged.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The winds are restless.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I sculpt thin shadows in the sand,</p>
<p>for waking is the sister of pain.</p>
<p>I watch white tongued waves devour them</p>
<p>for a while.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Only froth is left behind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I walk the sunrise</p>
<p>my mind takes a form</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Limbs of hardened jelly fish</p>
<p>hang from driftwood,</p>
<p>my neck</p>
<p>and patiently waits for its reward.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The sky is dry</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I listen to the growl of sanity</p>
<p>for bliss is the sister of ignorance.</p>
<p>I steal the smell of sleep</p>
<p>for a living.</p>
