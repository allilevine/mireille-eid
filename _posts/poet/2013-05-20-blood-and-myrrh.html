<p>Another piercing.</p>
<p>This time to take something out.</p>
<p>Squatting amongst velvet walls</p>
<p>a forgotten body of water</p>
<p>has stagnated</p>
<p>with the passing of the months.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She did not know</p>
<p>it was there</p>
<p>she had been swimming</p>
<p>watching the horizon swell</p>
<p>mistaking it for a life form.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Now, they slide and they stir</p>
<p>just behind the clamped opening</p>
<p>key after key</p>
<p>Oh! what froth</p>
<p>to tantalise the waiting crowd!</p>
<p> </p>
<p>It will come </p>
<p>they tell her</p>
<p>with a feeling of something pushing</p>
<p>her legs apart.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Not at all</p>
<p>with the pain</p>
<p>once green, once red</p>
<p>flashing against the needles</p>
<p>and the chemistry.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The invasion begins</p>
<p>emptying her body</p>
<p>only her ears are left intact</p>
<p>to listen to the rustling </p>
<p>of the plastic sheeting beneath her.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And the hushed voices,</p>
<p>they keep caressing a shell</p>
<p>made of a thin membrane</p>
<p>a mother has woven</p>
<p>on another planet</p>
<p>another bed</p>
<p>another time.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>The counting of the ghosts</p>
<p>the ebb and flow of the fists</p>
<p>no, not yet</p>
<p>bruises have not yet formed</p>
<p>on her forehead, her arms</p>
<p>her breasts and her thighs.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She has to wait</p>
<p>for the ceremonial floods</p>
<p>for the tearing of the soaked skin</p>
<p>for the carcass with the kohl</p>
<p>in its eyes.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>Nothing, nothing</p>
<p>the gloved hands</p>
<p>open and shut</p>
<p>open and shut</p>
<p>escape, escape</p>
<p>blood and myrrh</p>
<p>and all the way down to hell.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>But the sky</p>
<p>finally</p>
<p>rewards her with the putrid jewel</p>
<p>a crown, a rope</p>
<p>a lost totem</p>
<p>it leaves her blind, deaf and mute.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>And lucky they tell her</p>
<p>that her night has ended</p>
<p>before dawn</p>
<p>twisted from the deluge</p>
<p>and with no air for it to breathe.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>She can go home now.</p>
