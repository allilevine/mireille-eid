  <br />
  Sinister causes<br />
  etched on her back<br />
  An organ<br />
  whipping up screams<br />
  And splinters of others?<br />
  they hide in her crevices<br />
  Salt for the beloved<br />
  a gift gone astray<br />
  Her hands<br />
  frail as a halo<br />
  pick the scattered bones<br />
  Epiphany for the injured<br />
  jabbing needles in vain<br />
  Here<br />
  Repetition is unforgiving<br />
  Offerings<br />
  for a high priest<br />
  on communion days<br />
  And<br />
  there&#8217;s much to learn<br />
  from the one with no laughter<br />
  and a heart that beats<br />
  for hearses<br />
  wounded ponderings and stone<br />
  She<br />
  probes<br />
  sanity and ellipses<br />
  For survival<br />
  is a game she learnt to play<br />
  with razors<br />
  sterile and ready<br />
  on shiny trays</p>
