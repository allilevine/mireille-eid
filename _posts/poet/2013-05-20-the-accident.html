<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>On a sinuous road</p>
<p> A snake spreads its belly on hot asphalt </p>
<p> Licking sun rays with a fork </p>
<p> Car wheels dance to spinning curves </p>
<p> Nailing a head and lashing a tail. </p>
<p> But crucifixion </p>
<p> Is an ancient practice </p>
<p> For censorship and feeding crows. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p> I watch the gliding birds. </p>
