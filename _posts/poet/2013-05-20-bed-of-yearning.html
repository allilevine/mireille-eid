<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jostled logic and gentle beating</p>
<p>carve and twist</p>
<p>at the mirages they have erected for you </p>
<p>like the choking of the drowned. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for the mad dogs </p>
<p>they have learned to walk by your side </p>
<p>and wait for chewed up morsels </p>
<p>fear has spat in disgust </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But sleep for now </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sleep on a bed of yearning and sewn up flesh </p>
<p>Equality, Justice and the Brotherhood of Man </p>
<p>exit from your brain like the amputees </p>
<p>you have left behind </p>
<p>heading for the sea </p>
<p>while pretending there are no observers. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But pretend for now </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>for the disease of survival is,</p>
<p> grabbing at </p>
<p>your fists </p>
<p>and burying bruised heads in the sand. </p>
<p>You are molding the terrain of the future </p>
<p>with the coming of the tides </p>
<p>and the shroud of the crowds. </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>But ask yourself </p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Can dreams be made to float </p>
<p>on skulls </p>
<p>the breath of mercy </p>
<p>or even the sheath of silence? </p>
