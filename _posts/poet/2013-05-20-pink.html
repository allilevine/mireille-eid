<p>
  But the accident that brought her here<br />
  lingers <br />
  as if in slow motion<br />
  a memory sticking like a scab<br />
  She picks at it <br />
  exposing fresh cells<br />
  pink with the angst of renewal <br />
  They have not as yet witnessed <br />
  her skin&#8217;s delicate moments<br />
  She tastes the oozing droplets<br />
  iron masks for her tongue <br />
  and respire nausea&#8217;s inverted masses<br />
  Excuses&#8230; excuses <br />
  pummel a t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te <br />
  not meant for naked faces <br />
  A kind obsession <br />
  delves into the caves of je&#8217;ita <br />
  in rage and defiant <br />
  smelling of fresh kill<br />
  And now<br />
  bats stir and swarm for the entrance <br />
  turning day into night <br />
  sprinkling the earth spit<br />
  or<br />
  scalpels for the spring</p>
<p>  She is now ready for the autopsy.</p>
